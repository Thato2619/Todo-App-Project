# To-do List

This todo app was made with  the following three files:
```
-    * toDo.css
-    * toDo.html
-    * toDo.js

All of these files are stored in a ‘src’ folder.

As you open the app, you are introduced with gradient-filled background of blue and purple, with the heading of “ToDoList’ in a raleway font.

Under the heading is an input bar and filter bar  where you can write out the list of all your todos and see them listed below your input bar as you  press the ‘+’ sign.


Immediately you will be echoed with one or more of your written tasks of the day.

Each line of a listed task, consists with a  green ‘checked’ icon  and  purple ‘bin’ icon

- * The green ‘check’  icon will be used when you have completed your  task. To even see the effect of your completion, there will be text-decoration of line-through  to signify the finalty of your task


- * The purple ‘trash’ icon will be used when you want to delete or remove a task


Next to the input bar is a filer bar

This bar consist with:
```
- 'All'
- 'Completed' 
- 'Incomplete'

As the user presses along the filter bar, they will be able to see the what they have completed, what they still need to complete and 

even see all their tasks combined, whether it being completed or incomplete.
